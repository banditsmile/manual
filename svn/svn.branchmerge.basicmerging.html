      you work.  It's up to you to decide which changes are worth
      sharing; Subversion gives you the ability to selectively
      &#8220;<span class="quote">copy</span>&#8221; changes between branches.  And when you're
      completely finished with your branch, your entire set of branch
      changes can be copied back into the trunk.  In Subversion
      terminology, the general act of replicating changes from one
      branch to another is called <em class="firstterm">merging</em>, and
      it is performed using various invocations of the <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span> command.</p><p>In the examples that follow, we're assuming that both your
      Subversion client and server are running Subversion 1.5 (or
      later).  If either client or server is older than version 1.5,
      then things are more complicated: the system won't track changes
      automatically, and you'll have to use painful manual methods to
      achieve similar results.  That is, you'll always need to use the
      detailed merge syntax to specify specific ranges of revisions to
      replicate (See
      <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.advanced.html#svn.branchmerge.advanced.advancedsyntax"  title="Merge Syntax: Full Disclosure">&#8220;Merge Syntax:  Full Disclosure&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a> later
      in this chapter), and take special care to keep track of what's
      already been merged and what hasn't.  For this reason,
      we <span class="emphasis"><em>strongly</em></span> recommend making sure that your
      client and server are at least version 1.5 or later.</p><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="svn.branchmerge.changesets"></a>Changesets</h3></div></div></div><p>Before we get too far in, we should warn you that there's
        going to be a lot of discussion of &#8220;<span class="quote">changes</span>&#8221; in
        the pages ahead.  A lot of people experienced with version
        control systems use the terms &#8220;<span class="quote">change</span>&#8221;
        and &#8220;<span class="quote">changeset</span>&#8221; interchangeably, and we should
        clarify what Subversion understands as
        a <em class="firstterm">changeset</em>.</p><p>Everyone seems to have a slightly different definition
        of &#8220;<span class="quote">changeset,</span>&#8221; or at least a different
        expectation of what it means for a version control system to
        have one.  For our purpose, let's say that a changeset is just
        a collection of changes with a unique name.  The changes might
        include textual edits to file contents, modifications to tree
        structure, or tweaks to metadata.  In more common speak, a
        changeset is just a patch with a name you can refer to.</p><p>In Subversion, a global revision number N names a tree in
        the repository: it's the way the repository looked after the
        Nth commit.  It's also the name of an implicit changeset: if
        you compare tree N with tree N-1, you can derive the exact
        patch that was committed.  For this reason, it's easy to think
        of revision N as not just a tree, but a changeset as well.  If
        you use an issue tracker to manage bugs, you can use the
        revision numbers to refer to particular patches that fix
        bugs&#8212;for example,
        &#8220;<span class="quote">this issue was fixed by r9238.</span>&#8221; Somebody
        can then run <span class="command"><strong>svn log -r 9238</strong></span> to read about
        the exact changeset that fixed the bug, and run
        <span class="command"><strong>svn diff -c 9238</strong></span> to see the patch itself.
        And (as you'll see shortly)
        Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>merge</strong></span> command is able to use
        revision numbers.  You can merge specific changesets from one
        branch to another by naming them in the merge
        arguments: <span class="command"><strong>svn merge -c 9238</strong></span> would merge
        changeset r9238 into your working copy.</p></div><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="svn.branchemerge.basicmerging.stayinsync"></a>Keeping a Branch in Sync</h3></div></div></div><p>Continuing with our running example, let's suppose that a
        week has passed since you started working on your private
        branch.  Your new feature isn't finished yet, but at the same
        time you know that other people on your team have continued to
        make important changes in the
        project's <code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  It's in your best
        interest to replicate those changes to your own branch, just
        to make sure they mesh well with your changes.  In fact, this
        is a best practice: frequently keeping your branch in sync
        with the main development line helps
        prevent &#8220;<span class="quote">surprise</span>&#8221; conflicts when it comes time
        for you to fold your changes back into the trunk.</p><p>Subversion is aware of the history of your branch and
        knows when it divided away from the trunk.  To replicate the
        latest, greatest trunk changes to your branch, first make sure
        your working copy of the branch
        is &#8220;<span class="quote">clean</span>&#8221;&#8212;that it has no local
        modifications reported by <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.  Then
        simply run:</p><pre class="screen">
$ pwd
/home/user/my-calc-branch

$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk

U    button.c
U    integer.c
</pre><p>This basic syntax&#8212;<span class="command"><strong>svn merge
        URL</strong></span>&#8212;tells Subversion to merge all recent
        changes from the URL to the current working directory (which
        is typically the root of your working copy.)  After running
        the prior example, your branch working copy now contains new
        local modifications, and these edits are duplications of all
        of the changes that have happened on the trunk since you first
        created your branch:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn status
 M     .
M      button.c
M      integer.c
</pre><p>At this point, the wise thing to do is look at the changes
        carefully with <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>, and then build and
        test your branch.  Notice that the current working directory
        (&#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="filename">.</code></span>&#8221;) has also been
        modified; the <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> will show that
        its <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property has been either
        created or modified.  This is important merge-related metadata
        that you should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> touch, since it will
        be needed by future <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> commands.
        (We'll learn more about this metadata later in the
        chapter.)</p><p>After performing the merge, you might also need to resolve
        some conflicts (just as you do with <span class="command"><strong>svn
        update</strong></span>) or possibly make some small edits to get
        things working properly.  (Remember, just because there are
        no <span class="emphasis"><em>syntactic</em></span> conflicts doesn't mean there
        aren't any <span class="emphasis"><em>semantic</em></span> conflicts!)  If you
        encounter serious problems, you can always abort the local
        changes by running <span class="command"><strong>svn revert . -R</strong></span> (which
        will undo all local modifications) and start a
        long &#8220;<span class="quote">what's going on?</span>&#8221; discussion with your
        collaborators.  If things look good, however, then you can
        submit these changes into the repository:</p><pre class="screen">

          difference.  But <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> has special
          abilities that surpass the <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> program.
          The file format used by <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> is quite
          limited; it's able to tweak file contents only.  There's no
          way to represent changes to <span class="emphasis"><em>trees</em></span>, such
          as the addition, removal, or renaming of files and
          directories.  Nor can the <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> program
          notice changes to properties.  If Sally's change had,
          say, added a new directory, the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
          diff</strong></span> wouldn't have mentioned it at
          all.  <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> outputs only the limited
          patch format, so there are some ideas it simply can't
          express.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command, however, can
          express changes in tree structure and properties by directly
          applying them to your working copy.  Even more important,
          this command records the changes that have been duplicated
          to your branch, so that Subversion is aware of exactly which
          changes exist in each location (see
          <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergeinfo"  title="Mergeinfo and Previews">&#8220;Mergeinfo and Previews&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a>.)
          This is a critical feature that makes branch management

          yet.</p></div><p>Suppose that another week has passed.  You've committed
        more changes to your branch, and your comrades have continued

</pre><p>Congratulations, your branch has now been re-merged back
        into the main line of development.  Notice our use of
        the <code class="option">--reintegrate</code> option this time around.
        The option is critical for reintegrating changes from a branch
        back into its original line of development&#8212;don't forget
        it!  It's needed because this sort of &#8220;<span class="quote">merge
        back</span>&#8221; is a different sort of work than what you've been
        doing up until now.  Previously, we had been
        asking <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to grab the &#8220;<span class="quote">next
        set</span>&#8221; of changes from one line of development (the
        trunk) and duplicate them to another (your branch).  This is
        fairly straightforward, and each time Subversion knows how to
        pick up where it left off.  In our prior examples, you can see
        that first it merges the ranges 345:356 from trunk to branch;
        later on, it continues by merging the next contiguously
        available range, 356:380.  When doing the final sync, it
        merges the range 380:385.</p><p>When merging your branch back to the trunk, however, the
        underlying mathematics is quite different.  Your feature
        branch is now a mish-mosh of both duplicated trunk changes and
        private branch changes, so there's no simple contiguous range
        of revisions to copy over.  By specifying
        the <code class="option">--reintegrate</code> option, you're asking
        Subversion to carefully replicate <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
        those changes unique to your branch.  (And in fact it does
        this by comparing the latest trunk tree with the latest branch
        tree:  the resulting difference is exactly your branch
        changes!)</p><p>Now that your branch is merged to trunk, you have a couple
        of options.  You can keep working on your branch, repeating
        the whole process of occasionally syncing with the trunk and
        eventually using <code class="option">--reintegrate</code> to merge it
        back again.  Or, if you're really done with the branch, you
        can destroy your working copy of it and then remove it from
        the repository:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Remove my-calc-branch."
Committed revision 392.
</pre><p>But wait!  Isn't the history of that branch valuable?
        What if somebody wants to audit the evolution of your feature
        someday and look at all of your branch changes?  No need to
        worry.  Remember that even though your branch is no longer
        visible in the <code class="filename">/branches</code> directory, its
        existence is still an immutable part of the repository's
        history.  A simple <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> command on
        the <code class="filename">/branches</code> URL will show the entire
        history of your branch.  Your branch can even be resurrected
        at some point, should you desire (see
        <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.resurrect"  title="&#25214;&#22238;&#21024;&#38500;&#30340;&#39033;&#30446;">&#8220;&#25214;&#22238;&#21024;&#38500;&#30340;&#39033;&#30446;&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a>).</p></div><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergeinfo"></a>Mergeinfo and Previews</h3></div></div></div><p>The basic mechanism Subversion uses to track
        changesets&#8212;that is, which changes have been merged to
        which branches&#8212;is by recording data in properties.
        Specifically, merge data is tracked in
        the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property attached to
        files and directories.  (If you're not familiar with
        Subversion properties, now is the time to go skim over
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.html"  title="&#23646;&#24615;">&#8220;&#23646;&#24615;&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a>.)</p><p>You can examine the property, just like any
        other:</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:341-390
</pre><p>It is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> recommended that you change
        the value of this property yourself, unless you really know
        what you're doing.  This property is automatically maintained
        by Subversion whenever you run <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>.
        Its value indicates which changes (at a given path) have been
        replicated into the directory in question.  In this case, the
        path is <code class="filename">/trunk</code> and the directory which
        has received the specific changes
        is <code class="filename">/branches/my-calc-branch</code>.</p><p>There's also a subcommand <span class="command"><strong>svn
        mergeinfo</strong></span>, which can be helpful in seeing not only
        which changesets a directory has absorbed, but also which
        changesets it's still eligible to receive.  This gives a sort
        of preview of the next set of changes that <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> will replicate to your branch.</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch

</pre><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn mergeinfo</strong></span> command requires
        a &#8220;<span class="quote">source</span>&#8221; URL (where the changes would be coming
        from), and takes an optional &#8220;<span class="quote">target</span>&#8221; URL (where
        the changes would be merged to).  If no target URL is given,
        then it assumes that the current working directory is the
        target.  In the prior example, because we're querying our
        branch working copy, the command assumes we're interested in
        receiving changes to <code class="filename">/branches/mybranch</code>
        from the specified trunk URL.</p><p>Another way to get a more precise preview of a merge
        operation is to use the <code class="option">--dry-run</code>
        option.</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk --dry-run
U    integer.c

$ svn status
#  nothing printed, working copy is still unchanged.
</pre><p>The <code class="option">--dry-run</code> option doesn't actually
        apply any local changes to the working copy.  It shows only
        status codes that <span class="emphasis"><em>would</em></span> be printed in a
        real merge.  It's useful for getting a &#8220;<span class="quote">high
        level</span>&#8221; preview of the potential merge, for those times
        when running <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> gives too much
        detail.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">&#25552;&#31034;</h3><p>After performing a merge operation, but before committing
          the results of the merge, you can use <span class="command"><strong>svn diff
          --depth=empty /path/to/merge/target</strong></span> to see only
          the changes to the immediate target of your merge.  If your
          merge target was a directory, only property differences will
          be displayed.  This is a handy way to see the changes to the
          <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property recorded by the
          merge operation, which will remind you about what you've
          just merged.</p></div><p>Of course, the best way to preview a merge operation is to
        just do it!  Remember, running <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        isn't an inherently risky thing (unless you've made local
        modifications to your working copy&#8212;but we've already
        stressed that you shouldn't be merging into such an
        environment.)  If you don't like the results of the merge,
        simply <span class="command"><strong>svn revert . -R</strong></span> the changes from
        your working copy and retry the command with different
        options.  The merge isn't final until you
        actually <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> the results.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">&#25552;&#31034;</h3><p>While it's perfectly fine to experiment with merges by
          running <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
          revert</strong></span> over and over, you may run into some
          annoying (but easily bypassed) roadblocks.  For example, if
          the merge operation adds a new file (i.e., schedules it for
          addition), then <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> won't actually
          remove the file; it simply unschedules the addition.  You're
          left with an unversioned file.  If you then attempt to run
          the merge again, you may get conflicts due to the
          unversioned file &#8220;<span class="quote">being in the way.</span>&#8221; Solution?
          After performing a revert, be sure to clean up the working
          copy and remove unversioned files and directories.  The
          output of <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> should be as clean
          (read: empty) as possible!</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.undo"></a>&#21462;&#28040;&#20462;&#25913;</h3></div></div></div><p>An extremely common use for <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        is to roll back a change that has already been committed.
        Suppose you're working away happily on a working copy of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>, and you discover that the
        change made way back in revision 303, which changed
        <code class="filename">integer.c</code>, is completely wrong.  It never
        should have been committed.  You can use <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> to &#8220;<span class="quote">undo</span>&#8221; the change in your
        working copy, and then commit the local modification to the
        repository.  All you need to do is to specify a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>reverse</em></span> difference.  (You can do this by
        specifying <code class="option">--revision 303:302</code>, or by an
        equivalent <code class="option">--change -303</code>.)</p><pre class="screen">

When we talk about
        &#8220;<span class="quote">removing</span>&#8221; a change, we're really talking about
        removing it from the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision.  The
        original change still exists in the repository's history.  For
        most situations, this is good enough.  Most people are only
        interested in tracking the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> of a
        project anyway.  There are special cases, however, where you
        really might want to destroy all evidence of the commit.
        (Perhaps somebody accidentally committed a confidential
        document.)  This isn't so easy, it turns out, because
        Subversion was deliberately designed to never lose
        information.  Revisions are immutable trees that build upon
        one another.  Removing a revision from history would cause a
        domino effect, creating chaos in all subsequent revisions and
        possibly invalidating all working copies.

        revision, but the object still exists in earlier revisions.
        One of the most common questions new users ask is, &#8220;<span class="quote">How
        do I get my old file or directory back?</span>&#8221;</p><p>The first step is to define
        exactly <span class="bold"><strong>which</strong></span> item you're
        trying to resurrect.  Here's a useful metaphor: you can think
        of every object in the repository as existing in a sort of
        two-dimensional coordinate system.  The first coordinate is a
        particular revision tree, and the second coordinate is a path
        within that tree.  So every version of your file or directory
        can be defined by a specific coordinate pair.  (Remember the
        &#8220;<span class="quote">peg revision</span>&#8221;
        syntax&#8212;foo.c@224&#8212;mentioned back in

        discover the exact coordinate pair you wish to resurrect.  A
        good strategy is to run <span class="command"><strong>svn log --verbose</strong></span>
        in a directory that used to contain your deleted item.  The
        <code class="option">--verbose</code> (<code class="option">-v</code>) option shows
        a list of all changed items in each revision; all you need to
        do is find the revision in which you deleted the file or
        directory.  You can do this visually, or by using another tool
        to examine the log output (via <span class="command"><strong>grep</strong></span>, or
        perhaps via an incremental search in an editor).</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>The plus sign in the status output indicates that the item
        isn't merely scheduled for addition, but scheduled for
        addition &#8220;<span class="quote">with history.</span>&#8221;  Subversion remembers
        where it was copied from.  In the future, running <span class="command"><strong>svn
        log</strong></span> on this file will traverse back through the
        file's resurrection and through all the history it had prior
        to revision 807.  In other words, this new
        <code class="filename">real.c</code> isn't really new; it's a direct
        descendant of the original, deleted file.  This is usually
        considered a good and useful thing.  If, however, you wanted
        to resurrect the file <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span>
        maintaining a historical link to the old file, this technique
        works just as well:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn cat http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk/real.c@807 &gt; ./real.c

$ svn add real.c
A         real.c

</pre><p>Although our example shows us resurrecting a file, note
        that these same techniques work just as well for resurrecting
        deleted directories.  Also note that a resurrection doesn't
        have to happen in your working copy&#8212;it can happen
        entirely in the repository:</p><pre class="screen">

Sooner or later, once you
      get the hang of branching and merging, you're going to have to
      ask Subversion to merge <span class="emphasis"><em>specific</em></span> changes
      from one place to another.  In order to do this, you're going to
      have to start passing more complicated arguments to <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span>.  This next section describes the fully expanded
      syntax of the command and discusses a number of common
      scenarios that require it.</p><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="svn.branchmerge.cherrypicking"></a>Cherrypicking</h3></div></div></div><p>Just as the term &#8220;<span class="quote">changeset</span>&#8221; is often used in
        version control systems, so is the term
        of <em class="firstterm">cherrypicking</em>.  This word refers to
        the act of choosing <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> specific
        changeset from a branch and replicating it to another.
        Cherrypicking may also refer to the act of duplicating a
        particular set of (not necessarily contiguous!) changesets
        from one branch to another.  This is in contrast to more
        typical merging scenarios, where the &#8220;<span class="quote">next</span>&#8221;
        contiguous range of revisions is duplicated
        automatically.</p><p>Why would people want to replicate just a single change?
        It comes up more often than you'd think.  For example, let's
        go back in time and imagine that you haven't yet merged your
        private feature-branch back to the trunk.  At the
        water cooler, you get word that Sally made an interesting
        change to <code class="filename">integer.c</code> on the trunk.
        Looking over the history of commits to the trunk, you see that
        in revision 355 she fixed a critical bug that directly
        impacts the feature you're working on.  You might not be ready
        to merge all the trunk changes to your branch just yet, but
        you certainly need that particular bugfix in order to continue
        your work.</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>This use-case of replicating
        (or <em class="firstterm">backporting</em>) bugfixes from one
        branch to another is perhaps the most popular reason for
        cherrypicking changes; it comes up all the time, for example,
        when a team is maintaining a &#8220;<span class="quote">release branch</span>&#8221; of
        software.  (We discuss this pattern in
        <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.html#svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.release"  title="&#21457;&#24067;&#20998;&#25903;">&#8220;&#21457;&#24067;&#20998;&#25903;&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a>.)</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">&#35686;&#21578;</h3><p>Did you notice how, in the last example, the merge
          invocation caused two distinct ranges of merges to be
          applied?  The <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command applied
          two independent patches to your working copy in order to
          skip over changeset 355, which your branch already
          contained.  There's nothing inherently wrong with this,
          except that it has the potential to make conflict resolution
          more tricky.  If the first range of changes creates
          conflicts, you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> resolve them
          interactively in order for the merge process to continue and
          apply the second range of changes.  If you postpone a
          conflict from the first wave of changes, the whole merge
          command will bail out with an error message.

        </p></div><p>A word of warning: while <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> are very similar in concept, they
        do have different syntax in many cases.  Be sure to read about
        them in <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.html"  title="&#31532;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&#31456;&nbsp;Subversion &#23436;&#20840;&#21442;&#32771;">&#31532;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&#31456; <i>Subversion &#23436;&#20840;&#21442;&#32771;</i></a> for details, or ask

        a place where it should apply the generated patch.  If the
        target isn't specified, it assumes you are trying to perform
        one of the following common operations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>&#20320;&#24076;&#26395;&#21512;&#24182;&#30446;&#24405;&#20462;&#25913;&#21040;&#24037;&#20316;&#25335;&#36125;&#30340;&#24403;&#21069;&#30446;&#24405;&#12290;</p></li><li><p>You want to merge the changes in a specific file into

        If you're feeling confused about exactly how merging works,
        you're not alone.  Many users (especially those new to version

        the command and about how and when the feature should be
        used.  But fear not, this command is actually much simpler

        copying of changes between branches, it will generally do the
        right thing automatically.  For example, a command like the
        following:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/some-branch
</pre><p>will attempt to duplicate any changes made
        on <code class="filename">some-branch</code> into your current working
        directory, which is presumably a working copy that shares some
        historical connection to the branch.  The command is smart
        enough to only duplicate changes that your working copy
        doesn't yet have.  If you repeat this command once a week, it
        will only duplicate the &#8220;<span class="quote">newest</span>&#8221; branch changes
        that happened since you last merged.</p><p>If you choose to use the <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        command in all its full glory by giving it specific revision
        ranges to duplicate, then the command takes three main
        arguments:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An initial repository tree (often called the
        <em class="firstterm">left side</em> of the
        comparison)</p></li><li><p>A final repository tree (often called the
        <em class="firstterm">right side</em> of the
        comparison)</p></li><li><p>A working copy to accept the differences as
        local changes (often called the <em class="firstterm">target</em>
        of the merge)</p></li></ol></div><p>Once these three arguments are specified, the two trees
        are compared, and the resulting differences are applied to the
        target working copy as local modifications.  When the command
        is done, the results are no different than if you had
        hand-edited the files or run various <span class="command"><strong>svn
        add</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span> commands
        yourself.  If you like the results, you can commit them.  If
        you don't like the results, you can simply <span class="command"><strong>svn

        and can be much more chaotic: the advanced user can ask the
        server to compare <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> two trees at all,
        even ones that are unrelated to the working copy!  This means
        there's large potential for human error.  Users will sometimes
        compare the wrong two trees, creating a delta that doesn't
        apply cleanly.  <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> will do its best
        to apply as much of the delta as possible, but some parts may
        be impossible.  Just as the Unix
        <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> command sometimes complains about
        &#8220;<span class="quote">failed hunks,</span>&#8221; <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> will
        similarly complain about &#8220;<span class="quote">skipped

        <code class="filename">baz.c</code> exists in both snapshots of the
        branch being compared, and the resulting delta wants to
        change the file's contents, but the file doesn't exist in
        the working copy.  Whatever the case, the
        &#8220;<span class="quote">skipped</span>&#8221; message means that the user is most
        likely comparing the wrong two trees; they're the classic
        sign of user error.  When this happens, it's easy to
        recursively revert all the changes created by the merge

        want to be automatically merged.  For example, perhaps your
        team's policy is to do new development work on
        <code class="filename">/trunk</code>, but to be more conservative about
        backporting changes to a stable branch you use for releasing
        to the public.  On one extreme, you can manually cherrypick
        single changesets from trunk to the branch&#8212;just the
        changes that are stable enough to pass muster.  Maybe things
        aren't quite that strict, though; perhaps most of the time
        you'd like to just let <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        automatically merge most changes from trunk to branch.  In
        this case, you'd like a way to mask a few specific changes
        out, i.e. prevent them from ever being automatically
        merged.</p><p>In Subversion 1.5, the only way to block a changeset is to
        make the system believe that the change has
        <span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> been merged.  To do this, one can
        invoke a merge command with the <code class="option">--record-only</code>
        option:</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305

# Let's make the metadata list r3328 as already merged.
$ svn merge -c 3328 --record-only http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk

$ svn status
M     .

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305,3328

$ svn commit -m "Block r3328 from being merged to the branch."
&#8230;
</pre><p>This technique works, but it's also a little bit
        dangerous.  The main problem is that we're not clearly
        differentiating between the ideas of &#8220;<span class="quote">I don't want this
        change</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span class="quote">I don't have this change.</span>&#8221;
        We're effectively lying to the system, making it think that
        the change was previously merged.  This puts the
        responsibility on you&#8212;the user&#8212;to remember that
        the change wasn't actually merged, it just wasn't wanted.
        There's no way to ask Subversion for a list of &#8220;<span class="quote">blocked
        changelists.</span>&#8221; If you want to track them (so that you
        can unblock them someday.) you'll need to record them in a
        text file somewhere, or perhaps in an invented property.  In
        Subversion 1.5, unfortunately, this is the only way to manage
        blocked revisions; the plans are to make a better interface
        for this in future versions.</p></div><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="svn.branchmerge.advanced.logblame"></a>Merge-Sensitive Logs and Annotations</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the main features of any version control system is
        to keep track of who changed what, and when they did it.
        The <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        blame</strong></span> commands are just the tools for this: when
        invoked on individual files, they show not only the history of
        changesets that affected the file, but exactly which user
        wrote which line of code, and when they did it.</p><p>When changes start getting replicated between branches,
        however, things start to get complicated.  For example, if you
        were to ask <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> about the history of
        your feature branch, it shows exactly every revision that ever
        affected the branch:</p><pre class="screen">

        it would notice that they're unrelated and first attempt to
        delete the old file, then add the new file;  the output would
        indicate a deletion followed by an add:</p><pre class="screen">

      </pre><p>Most merges involve comparing trees that are ancestrally
        related to one another; therefore, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> defaults to this behavior.  Occasionally,
        however, you may want the <span class="command"><strong>merge</strong></span> command to
        compare two unrelated trees.  For example, you may have
        imported two source-code trees representing different vendor
        releases of a software project (see
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.vendorbr.html"  title="Vendor Branches">&#8220;Vendor Branches&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a>).  If you ask
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to compare the two trees, you'd
        see the entire first tree being deleted, followed by an add
        of the entire second tree!  In these situations, you'll want
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to do a path-based comparison
        only, ignoring any relations between files and directories.
        Add the <code class="option">--ignore-ancestry</code> option to your
        <span class="command"><strong>merge</strong></span> command, and it will behave just
          like <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>.  (And conversely, the
        <code class="option">--notice-ancestry</code> option will cause
        <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> to behave like the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command.)</p></div><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="svn.branchmerge.advanced.moves"></a>&#21512;&#24182;&#21644;&#31227;&#21160;</h3></div></div></div><p>&#19968;&#20010;&#26222;&#36941;&#30340;&#24895;&#26395;&#26159;&#37325;&#26500;&#28304;&#31243;&#24207;&#65292;&#29305;&#21035;&#26159;Java&#36719;&#20214;&#39033;&#30446;&#12290;&#22312;&#25913;&#21517;&#20013;&#25991;&#20214;&#21644;&#30446;&#24405;&#21464;&#20081;&#65292;&#36890;&#24120;&#23548;&#33268;&#27599;&#20010;&#39033;&#30446;&#25104;&#21592;&#30340;&#26497;&#22823;&#30772;&#22351;&#12290;&#21548;&#36215;&#26469;&#22909;&#20687;&#24212;&#35813;&#20351;&#29992;&#20998;&#25903;&#65292;&#19981;&#26159;&#21527;&#65311;&#21482;&#26159;&#21019;&#24314;&#20998;&#25903;&#65292;&#21464;&#20081;&#20107;&#24773;&#65292;&#28982;&#21518;&#21512;&#24182;&#22238;&#20027;&#24178;&#65292;&#19981;&#23545;&#21527;&#65311;</p><p>Alas, this scenario doesn't work so well right now and
        is considered one of Subversion's current weak spots.  The
        problem is that Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>update</strong></span>
        command isn't as robust as it should be, particularly when
        dealing with copy and move operations.</p><p>When you use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> to duplicate a
        file, the repository remembers where the new file came from,
        but it fails to transmit that information to the client which
        is running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span>.  Instead of telling the client, &#8220;<span class="quote">Copy
        that file you already have to this new location,</span>&#8221; it
        instead sends down an entirely new file.  This can lead to
        problems, especially because the same thing happens with
        renamed files.  A lesser-known fact about Subversion is that
        it lacks &#8220;<span class="quote">true renames</span>&#8221;&#8212;the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        move</strong></span> command is nothing more than an aggregation
        of <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        delete</strong></span>.</p><p>&#20363;&#22914;&#65292;&#20551;&#23450;&#25105;&#20204;&#22312;&#19968;&#20010;&#31169;&#26377;&#20998;&#25903;&#24037;&#20316;&#65292;&#20320;&#23558;<code class="filename">integer.c</code>&#25913;&#21517;&#20026;<code class="filename">whole.c</code>&#65292;&#20320;&#36825;&#26159;&#22312;&#20998;&#25903;&#19978;&#21019;&#24314;&#20102;&#21407;&#26469;&#25991;&#20214;&#30340;&#19968;&#20010;&#25335;&#36125;&#65292;&#24182;&#19988;&#21024;&#38500;&#20102;&#21407;&#26469;&#30340;&#25991;&#20214;&#12290;&#21516;&#26102;&#65292;&#22238;&#21040;<code class="filename">trunk</code>&#65292;Sally&#25552;&#20132;&#20102;&#19968;&#20123;<code class="filename">integer.c</code>&#30340;&#20462;&#25913;&#65292;&#25152;&#20197;&#20320;&#38656;&#35201;&#23558;&#20998;&#25903;&#21512;&#24182;&#21040;&#20027;&#24178;&#65306;</p><pre class="screen">

      </pre><p>This doesn't look so bad at first glance, but it's also
        probably not what you or Sally expected.  The merge operation
        has deleted the latest version of
        the <code class="filename">integer.c</code> file (the one containing
        Sally's latest changes), and blindly added your
        new <code class="filename">whole.c</code> file&#8212;which is a
        duplicate of the <span class="emphasis"><em>older</em></span> version
        of <code class="filename">integer.c</code>.  The net effect is that
        merging your &#8220;<span class="quote">rename</span>&#8221; to the branch has removed
        Sally's recent changes from the latest revision!</p><p>This isn't true data loss; Sally's changes are still in
        the repository's history, but it may not be immediately
        obvious that this has happened.  The moral of this story is
        that until Subversion improves, be very careful about
        merging copies and renames from one branch to
        another.</p></div><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="svn.branchmerge.advanced.pre1.5clients"></a>Blocking Merge-Unaware Clients</h3></div></div></div><p>If you've just upgraded your server to Subversion 1.5 or
        later, then there's a significant risk that pre-1.5 Subversion
        clients can mess up your automated merge tracking.  Why is
        this?  When a pre-1.5 Subversion client performs <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span>, it doesn't modify the value of
        the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property at all.  So the
        subsequent commit, despite being the result of a merge,
        doesn't tell the repository about the duplicated
        changes&#8212;that information is lost.  Later on,
        when &#8220;<span class="quote">merge-aware</span>&#8221; clients attempt automatic
        merging, they're likely to run into all sorts of conflicts
        resulting from repeated merges.</p><p>If you and your team are relying on the merge-tracking
        features of Subversion, then you may want to configure your
        repository to prevent older clients from committing changes.
        The easy way to do this is by inspecting
        the &#8220;<span class="quote">capabilities</span>&#8221; parameter in
        the <code class="literal">start-commit</code> hook script.  If the
        client reports itself as having <code class="literal">mergeinfo</code>
        capabilities, the hook script can allow the commit to start.
        If the client doesn't report that capability, have the hook
        deny the commit.  We'll learn more about hook scripts in the
        next chapter; see
